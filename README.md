# Data analysis and Machine Learning

I have created two projects of machine Learning.
Firstly, I did some data analysis on the given dataset , then I trained the model on the Machine Learning algortihms , such as;
LogisticRegrssion , DecisionTree, RandomForest and GredientBoosting.
So many I could Use...

Try your best to those algorithms for getting higher and higher accuracy , that's what we need to use multiple algorithms of ML to get high accuracy.
If you can change the code above and get the higher and higher , then use the ML more algorithms and commit here..

thank you.
